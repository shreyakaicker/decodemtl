Looking for smart, hungry web developers to join your team? Come meet the graduates from our Web Development Immersive program! Over an 8-week program taught by industry experts and thought leaders, our graduates have covered a wide range of technologies - including HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Node, React), SQL, along with other languages and frameworks!

This is a public event and we encourage anyone interested in hiring our students, working with us, or attending our courses to come and join! The event is setup as follows:

  * 3:30PM - 4:00PM - Registration
  * 4:00PM - 5:30PM - Student Demos
  * 5:30PM - 6:30PM - Closing Comments & Networking

DecodeMTL does not collect a commission for hiring our graduates and never will.

Can't make it? Email [kevin@decodemtl.com](mailto:kevin@decodemtl.com) to find out how you can still get in touch with our graduates.
